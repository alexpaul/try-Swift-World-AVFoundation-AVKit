# UIImagePickerController, AVFoundation and AVKit

Looking to integrate video into your application? In this workshop you will get an introduction to AVFoundation and AVKit for video playback. We will also be using UIImagePickerController to capture video from the user’s device. The capture video will also be persisted to the user’s device for future playback.
